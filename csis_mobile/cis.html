		<h1>Computer Information Systems</h1>
		
		<p>The Computer Information Systems program and Computer Science program share many of the same core classes
		to ensure that students are adequately prepared with the necessary background for their upper class studies.
		This common core includes programming both in a Windows graphical environment as well as in a Unix command-line environment.
		Industry uses both operating systems and so the Department wants students to be well versed in each area.  Additionally, 
		students will learn C++ and Microsoft Visual Basic as toolsets to develop applications.  The common core also includes 
		introductory data structures, statistics with computer applications, web client development and web server development.
		Both majors are heavily programming-oriented.  The curriculum has been designed this way on purpose so that students can 
		learn about a concept and then use their programming knowledge as a vehicle to understand, experiment and implement that topic.
		Both programs do a great job in preparing students for their future in industry or to pursue a graduate degree</p>
		<br />
		<p>Computer Information Systems tends to be more application oriented than Computer Science and geared toward application 
		development with some business emphasis.  Computer Information Systems majors will see the following in their degree program:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Topical Coverage Synopsis: Models, technologies, systems and E-business strategies that are crucial in todayâ€™s businesses</li>
			<li>Cutting-edge technology skills and knowledge:
				<ul>
					<li>Application Areas: Data Communications, Database, e-Commerce, .NET development</li>
					<li>Technical Topics: system integration & management, systems design and analysis, enterprise database systems & transaction processing and much more</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
