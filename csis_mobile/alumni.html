		<h1>Jesse Vollmar & Brad Kock-Home grown success</h1>
		<p>Brad Koch, 2011, B.S., and Jesse Vollmar, 2011, B.S., weren&rsquo;t typical college students. 
		As incoming freshmen at SVSU, the two were already running a successful IT consulting business.
		Since their 2011 graduation, both with a Bachelor of Science in computer science, they&rsquo;ve also
		“graduated” from their initial business and have started a new company, FarmLogs, which has attracted
		a lot of investor interest as well as $5million in venture capital.</p>
