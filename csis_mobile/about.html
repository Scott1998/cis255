		<h1>About Us</h1>
	

		<p>Do I really need to worry about the department itself?</p><br />
		<p>Absolutely!  No matter where you go to school, your major is determined by the faculty that comprise that particular department.
			These professors are the individuals whom you will spend a lot of time with in classes, laboratories and in completing homework 
			assignments and projects.  They help to shape your future and take great interest in their students.</p> <br />
		<p>You&rsquo;ll find SVSU&rsquo;s Department of Computer Science & Information Systems is staffed by qualified, competent professionals who are
			committed to teaching and research.  We are here to help you grow and succeed in your academic and professional career.  Our 
			class sizes are small compared to other institutions and you&rsquo;ll get to know and work with the CSIS faculty one-on-one.  This 
			helps to foster a learning environment aimed at student success.</p><br />
